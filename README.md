# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis-using-BERT-and-Deep-Learning
I have made this project into a ready to run Google Colaboratory notebook so that you won't counter any dependecy or version issues. The complete instructions are available in the notebook text cells itself.
Just be sure to install transformers, though I have included a cell for transformer installation as well - run it.
You can also customize the code by changing the number of seeds and epochs for better results. The dataset used is Smile Twitter Emotion Dataset which is a bit biased, so make sure to atleast train some instances of each class.
